Name: Weller by Cohiba
Description: Two big names have combined to make one of 2022’s best – and most anticipated cigars: Weller by Cohiba. The 5-country blend produces an enamoring profile, but aging the Connecticut Broadleaf binder in Buffalo Trace bourbon barrels adds a savory, inside-the-cask sensation of honey, oak and spice. Our staff agreed, Weller by Cohiba 2022 is a genuinely impressive smoke.

Name: CAO Pilon Anejo
Description: Upon rolling, CAO put these Pilon cigars down for a 2-year hibernation…and that deep rest has brought out even more character from these “matured” cigars. We found a sweeping array of flavors including tobacco sweetness, oak, leather, earth, and cranberries in a smoke that burns medium plus. Worth the wait.

Name: Espinosa & Guy Fieri Knuckle Sandwich
Description: A flavor bomb, from the Mayor of Flavortown. Knuckle Sandwich from Guy Fieri and Erik Espinosa packs a gourmet punch of black pepper, nutmeg, hazelnut and leather, all (barely) contained in a plume of creamy smoke. And it only seems to get better as it smokes.

Name: Los Statos Deluxe
Description:Los Statos is a revival of an old classic, pre-revolution Cuban cigar brand…but this version counts on a prime Ecuador Sumatra wrapper and a blend of proprietary Nicaraguan and Dominican long fillers to produce its rich notes of cocoa, coffee, baking spices and more. Medium-bodied, so it’s very accessible for most cigar smokers.

Name: HVC Vieja Cosecha
Description: This time, the Vieja Cosecha name translates to “old crop” – and five-year-aged Aganorsa tobaccos yield a medley of nuances that include earth, citrus, cedar, and sweet spices.

Name: Rojas Street Tacos
Description: A huge boutique surprise from Noel Rojas, Street Tacos Barbacoa cigars combine an Ecuador Sumatra wrapper with Nicaraguan binder and long filler – which, when enjoyed together, burn with full-bodied notes of coffee, dry wood, pepper, and an earthy, salty sweetness.

Name: Foundation Olmec
Description: Foundation Olmec pays tribute to the origin of tobacco, where the first Mesoamericans cultivated and smoked it. Tobacco is still a way of life in the same spot today, the San Andres valley of Mexico – which is also home to Olmec’s rare Claro wrapper leaf. The tobacco gets its lighter color from a shorter fermentation cycle, but overflows with notes of earth, coffee, cocoa, and spice.
