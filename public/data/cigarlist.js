        description: "Two big names have combined to make one of 2022’s best – and most anticipated cigars: Weller by Cohiba. The 5-country blend produces an enamoring profile, but aging the Connecticut Broadleaf binder in Buffalo Trace bourbon barrels adds a savory, inside-the-cask sensation of honey, oak and spice. Our staff agreed, Weller by Cohiba 2022 is a genuinely impressive smoke.",
